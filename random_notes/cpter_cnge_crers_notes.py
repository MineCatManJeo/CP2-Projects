# What are some security concerns (for the user, not for the code) programmers need to think about when building a project? 

#  Basic - Not needed but i want it in my notes
#   Look nice
#   Understand Easily
#   Informative Errors
#   Knowing what it does

#  Security - Needed for notes
#   Not asking for unnecessary things -
#     Knowing what it does / what we need

#   Info kept private -
#     Encrypt User Info
#     Passwords donverted to hash

#    We convert passwords to hash
#    WE KEEP INFO SEPERATE


# What are some pro's and con's of the automation of jobs?

#   Pros:
#     Creating jobs for creating machine learning programs
#     We can create machines that can do things too dangerous for humans
#     Taking the jobs people don't want to do
#     Less time spent doing harder jobs
#     More quality products
#     More quality of life in general because of new technology

#   Cons:
#     People lose many jobs, compared to population growth people less jobs are being formed
#     Leads to more unemployeed and more impoverished people
#     The select few people who own the machines might be the rulers of the world
#     Quality of life may go down as more people become unemployed and poor.
